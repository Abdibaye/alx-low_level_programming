Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee mandatory

The woman who has no imagination has no wings mandatory

If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize mandatory

It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe mandatory

I will show you how great I am #advanced
